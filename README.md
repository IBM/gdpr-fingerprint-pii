# Fingerprinting personal data from unstructured documents

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be a new regulation in EU which will come into effect in May 2018. This new regulation applies to those organizations, including those outside EU, which collect and process personal data. It aims to give more control to individuals over usage of their personal data.

Right to forget - Under the new GDPR, organizations around the world must not only protect personal data but also forget personal data on request from individuals.

When a customer requests that all his or her personal data be deleted, then an organisation needs to identify all the documents where the customer's personal data reside. This code pattern addresses the need to identify the personal data from the provided documents. Also, we will see how to assign a confidence score for the personal data that indicates the confidence level in identifying an individual uniquely as part of the code pattern.

Let us try to understand this with an example chat transcript as below

```
Rep: This is Thomas. How can I help you?
Caller: This is Alex. I want to change my plan to corporate plan
Rep: Sure, I can help you. Do you want to change the plan for the number from which you are calling now?
Caller: yes
Rep: For verification purpose may I know your date of birth and email id
Caller: My data of birth is 10-Aug-1979 and my email id is alex@gmail.com
Rep: Which plan do you want to migrate to
Caller: Plan 450 unlimited
Rep: Can I have your company name and date of joining
Caller: I work for IBM and doj 01-Feb-99
Rep: Ok.. I have taken your request to migrate plan to 450 unlimited. You will get an update in 3 hours. Is there anything else that I can help you with
Caller: No
Rep: Thanks for calling Vodaphone. Have a good day
Caller: you too
```

Personal Data extracted from the above text:

```
Name: Alex
Date of birth: 10-Aug-1979
Email id: alex@gmail.com
Company: IBM
Date of joining: 01-Feb-99
```

Also the confidence score is calculated

```
Confidence score: 0.7
```

This code pattern gives you a step by step instructions for:
- Building a custom model using Watson Knowledge Studio (WKS) and having Natural Language Understanding (NLU) use that model for personal data extraction.
- Using regular expressions, in addition to NLU, to extract personal data from unstructured text.
- Configuring pre-identified personal data with weightage and coming up with a score representing the confidence level of identifying an individual using the personal data identified.
- Viewing the score and the personal data identified in a tree structure for better visualization.
- Consuming the output of this code pattern by other applications.

## Flow

![Architecture/Flow diagram](./images/Architecture.png)

1. Viewer passes input text to Personal Data Extractor.
2. Personal Data Extractor passes the text to NLU.
3. Personal Data extracted from the input text. NLU uses custom model to provide the response.
4. Personal Data Extractor passes NLU Output to Regex component.
5. Regex component uses the regular expressions provided in configuration to extract personal data which is then augmented to the NLU Output.
6. The augmented personal data is passed to scorer component.
7. Scorer component uses the configuration to come up with a overall document score and the result is passed back to Personal Data Extractor component.
8. This data is then passed to viewer component.

### 1. Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud account: If you do not have an IBM Cloud account, you can create an account [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/).
- Cloud Foundry cli should be installed. If not installed, click [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) for instructions to install.
- Watson Knowledge Studio account: User must have a WKS account. If you do not have
  an account, you can create a free account [here](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html?a=IBMWatsonKnowledgeStudio).
  Make a note of the login URL since it is unique to every login id
- Basic knowledge of building models in WKS: The user must possess basic knowledge
  of building model in WKS in order to build a custom model. Check getting started documentation [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/knowledge-studio/tutorials-create-project.html#wks_tutintro)


### 2. Concepts used

#### 2.1 Data extraction methods

We have to define what personal data (e.g. Name, Email id) we would want to extract. This is done in two ways in this code pattern.
A) Using Custom model built using Watson Knowledge Studio (WKS) and
B) Using regular expressions. Details of how these are used are explained in subsequent
sections.

#### 2.2  Configuration

We use configuration to extract personal data. Personal data are classified into different
categories. Each category is assigned a weight. Also we specify what personal data
belongs to which category.

A sample configuration is as shown below

```
Categories: Very_High,High,Medium,Low
Very_High_Weight: 50
High_Weight: 40
Medium_Weight: 20
Low_Weight: 10
Very_High_PIIs: MobileNumber,EmailId
High_PIIs: Person,DOB
Medium_PIIs: Name,DOJ
Low_PIIs: Company
regex_params: DOB,DOJ
DOB_regex: (0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- /.](Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)[- /.](19|20)\d\d
DOJ_regex: (0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])[- /.](Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)[- /.]\\d\\d
```

If you want to change configuration, then follow the below template

```
Categories: <new set of categories which are comma separated>. e.g. Categories: MyCategory1,MyCategory2,MyCategory3
<category_name>_Weight: Weightage for each category. e.g. MyCategory1_Weight: 40
<category>_PIIs: Personal data (Entity types). e.g. MyCategory1_PIIS: EmailId, Employee Id
regex_params: Entity types which have to be extracted using regular expressions. e.g. regex_params:
Date
<regex_param>_regex: Regular expression using which an entity needs to be extracted from text e.g. Date_regex:
(0[1-9]|[12]\[0-9]|3[01])
```

#### 2.3 Brief description of application components

##### 2.3.1 Personal Data Extractor component:

Personal Data Extractor component is the controller which controls the flow of data
between all the components. It also integrates with NLU.

##### 2.3.2 Regex component:

Regex component parses the input text using the regular expressions provided in the
configuration files to extract personal data. Regular expressions are used to extract
personal data to augment NLU output.

##### 2.3.3 Scorer component:

Scorer component calculates the score of a document, which is between 0 and 1, based
on the personal data identified and the configuration data. It uses the below algorithm

```
Let score be 0
    For each category{
	   cat_weight = weightage for the category
	   cat_entity_types = list of entity types for the category
	   for each cat_entity_types{
	      score = score +( ( cat_weight/100 ) * ( 100 - score ) )
	   }
    }
score = score / 100; // to make it between 0 and 1
```

##### 2.3.4 Viewer component:

Viewer component is the user interface component of the application. User can browse a file, containing chat transcript, and submit to personal data extraction component. After processed personal data are then shown in a tree view, along with the overall confidence score.

You can learn more about Type Systems [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/knowledge-studio/typesystem.html#typesystem)
Type Systems can either be created or imported from an already created Type Systems json file. It is left to user to create his or her own Type systems or use a Type Systems json file provided in this repository. If you wish to import the Type Systems json file, then download the file named `TypeSystems.json` under the folder `WKS` in this repository to your local file system. The json file has entity types such as Name, PhoneNo, EmailId, Address. You can edit/add/delete entity types to suit your requirement.

### 4.1.2 Documents

You can learn more about Documents [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/knowledge-studio/documents-for-annotation.html#wks_t_docs_intro)
We will need a set of documents to train and evaluate the WKS model. These documents will contain the unstructured text from which we will identify personal data. Refer to some of the sample document files under the folder `SampleChatTranscripts`. To train WKS model, a large and varied set of documents are needed. To complete this exercise, let us consider a smaller set of documents.

You can either have your own set of documents or use the ones provided in this git repository. It is placed under `WKS/Documents.zip`. If you decide to use the documents provided in this repo, then download the file to your local file system.
